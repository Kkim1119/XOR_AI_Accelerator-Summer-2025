# XOR_AI_Accelerator-Summer-2025
Contains code related to a deep learning XOR prediction model that uses linear regression + classification to accurately predict the output of a 2-input XOR gate. There are two version of this code: one being in purely C++ meant to be run as software and another coded in HLS programming to model an accelerator on an FPGA.
